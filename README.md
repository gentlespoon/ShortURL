# ShortURL

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Development server

Due to the integration of PHP code, the regular `ng serve` will not work with POST requests and PHP files.

To run a development server, you must have a full server.

You may use Apache, Nginx, Express, IIS, or whatever server you prefer as long as it supports executing PHP scripts.

Run `ng build --watch` for a watched build.

Point your server document root to `dist` directory.

Navigate to `http(s)://Your_URL/`.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
