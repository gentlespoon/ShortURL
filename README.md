### Need a backend server to work


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Development server

Due to the integration of PHP code, the regular `ng serve` will not work with POST requests and PHP files.

To run a development server, you must have a full server.

You may use Apache, Nginx, Express, IIS, or whatever server you prefer as long as it supports executing PHP scripts.

Run `ng build --watch` for a watched build.

Point your server document root to `dist` directory.

Navigate to `http(s)://Your_URL/`.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
