<h2>Create a short URL</h2>
<pre>
You can shorten URLs to make them easier to share using the Gs-ShortURL. For example, the short URL <a href="http://gtspn.com/sample" target="_blank">http://gtspn.com/sample</a> takes people to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&t=840s&this-Is_To=MakeThings&LookExtra&LongBut=ThisDoesNotDo&Anything=AtAll" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&t=840s&this-Is_To=MakeThings&LookExtra&LongBut=ThisDoesNotDo&Anything=AtAll</a>.
